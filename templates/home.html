            <p>This app is used to find genes that are fairly new and aren't a part of Radboud's genpanels yet.</p>

            <h3>Using the search feature:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Enter your desired search term to the term field.</li>

            <h3>How to interpret the results:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>On the top of page a UUID will be displayed, with this UUID you'll be able to find your results again.</li>
                <li>Beneath the UUID you will find the query used for your search, the selected genpanel and the selected date.</li>
                <li>Underneath the search information, you will be able to see your results.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The left column displays newly found genes, together with their gene id, how often they're found in an article,
                            and the article ID of the article they were found in.</li>
                        <li>The right column will display the disease name, together with their MESH id, how often they're found in
                            an article and the article id of the article they're found in.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You can click on either the genes or diseases to highlight the ones found in the same article.</li>
            </ol>
